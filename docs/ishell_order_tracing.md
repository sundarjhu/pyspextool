# iSHELL Order Tracing — Developer Notes

## Overview

This document describes the **first-pass order-centre tracing scaffold** for
iSHELL 2DXD reduction in `pyspextool`.  The tracing scaffold lives in:

    src/pyspextool/instruments/ishell/tracing.py

It is the first quantitative analysis stage after the visual diagnostics
in `pyspextool.ishell.diagnostics` and before full 2DXD wavelength
calibration.

> **Status**: This is a development scaffold, not a finalised geometry
> calibration.  The outputs are suitable for smoke-testing the pipeline and
> exploring the data, but should **not** be used for science-quality spectral
> rectification without further validation and refinement.

---

## Purpose and Scope

This module implements **order-centre tracing from flat-field frames** —
one narrow but essential piece of the 2DXD reduction scaffold.

What it does:

* loads one or more raw iSHELL QTH flat-field FITS files,
* median-combines them to suppress read noise and hot pixels,
* finds order-centre peaks in cross-dispersion profiles at a set of
  evenly-spaced detector columns,
* traces each order centre across all sample columns, and
* fits a low-order polynomial to each traced trajectory.

What it does **not** do (yet):

* full order edge tracing,
* tilt or curvature measurement from arc frames,
* wavelength calibration,
* spectral rectification.

---

## Data Used

The scaffold was exercised against the real H1-mode calibration dataset at:

    data/testdata/ishell_h1_calibrations/raw/

| File                                          | Type    | Count |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| `icm.2026A060.260214.flat.000{50..54}.a.fits` | QTH flat | 5    |
| `icm.2026A060.260214.arc.00055.a.fits`        | ThAr arc | 1    |
| `icm.2026A060.260214.arc.00056.b.fits`        | ThAr arc | 1    |

These files are stored in Git LFS.  Run `git lfs pull` before attempting
to open them.  The test suite detects LFS pointer files and skips real-data
tests gracefully when the actual pixel data is not present.

---

## Algorithm

### 1. Frame loading and combination

```python
flat = load_and_combine_flats(flat_files)
```

All FITS PRIMARY extensions (extension 0) are read as `float32` arrays
and stacked along a new axis.  The pixel-wise median is taken; this
suppresses cosmic rays, hot pixels, and occasional bad reads more
robustly than the mean.

### 2. Seed peak detection

At the seed column (default: mid-point of the column range), a
cross-dispersion profile is computed by taking the pixel-wise **median**
over a band of columns `[col − col_half_width, col + col_half_width]`.
A light Gaussian smoothing (σ = 1 pixel) is applied to reduce fringing
features while preserving the broad order peaks.

Order-centre positions are found using `scipy.signal.find_peaks` with:

| Parameter     | Default | Rationale                                               |
|---------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `distance`    | 25      | ≈ half the expected inter-order spacing of ≈ 46 px     |
| `prominence`  | 500     | robust against slowly-varying blaze; suppresses fringe  |

### 3. Column-by-column tracking

The algorithm walks from the seed column outward in both directions.  At
each step a **running position estimate** per order is maintained:

```
current_est[i]  ← last matched peak row for order i
```

For each new column:

1. Compute the smoothed cross-dispersion profile.
2. Find peaks with the same `distance` and `prominence` thresholds.
3. For each order, match the nearest detected peak within `max_shift`
   pixels (default 15 px).
4. If a match is found, update `current_est[i]`; otherwise leave it
   unchanged so the next column still has a valid estimate to try.

This design prevents a single missed detection at one column from causing
cascading failures at subsequent columns.

### 4. Polynomial fitting with sigma-clipping

For each order, the valid (non-NaN) centre-row measurements are fitted
with a degree-`poly_degree` polynomial using
`numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polyfit` (default degree 3).

Three rounds of σ-clipping (default threshold 3σ) reject outlier
measurements caused by fringing features that briefly mislead the peak
finder.

### 5. Half-width estimation

The half-maximum half-width of each order peak at the seed column is
estimated by walking outward from the peak until the profile drops below
the half-maximum level.  This is a proxy for the order width and is used
to build approximate edge polynomials.

## What Was Observed from the H1 Dataset

The following measurements were made when running this first-pass scaffold
against the five H1 flat frames in the calibration dataset described above.
These are **observed results from a development scaffold**, not a finalised
or validated calibration.

| Measurement                              | Observed value               |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Orders detected at col 1100             | ~42–43 (45 expected)         |
| Median polynomial fit RMS               | ~3–4 pixels                  |
| Maximum polynomial fit RMS              | typically below 8 pixels in the current H1 run |
| Order centre range (rows) at col 1100   | ≈ 4 to 1985                  |
| Order spacing (row)                     | ≈ 46 pixels                  |
| Order half-width (row)                  | ≈ 16 pixels                  |

**Note on missing orders**: The 2–3 undetected orders (out of 45) are near
the detector edges where flat-lamp signal is low.  This is expected behaviour
for a first-pass scaffold using fixed prominence and distance thresholds.

**Observed offset from packaged calibration**: The traced order centres from
the raw 2026 H1 frames differ by approximately **−70 rows** from the
positions stored in the packaged ``H1_flatinfo.fits`` calibration resource.
The cause of this offset has **not yet been resolved**.  Possible explanations
include:

* detector orientation or rotation differences between the observations used
  to create ``H1_flatinfo.fits`` and the 2026 dataset,
* coordinate convention differences between the IDL and Python pipelines
  (e.g. 0-based vs. 1-based row indexing, or transposed array conventions),
* raw-frame preprocessing differences (e.g. bias subtraction or linearity
  correction) that shift the apparent order positions.

No conclusion about the usability of the packaged calibration files should
be drawn from this offset alone.  Further investigation is required.

## Usage

```python
from pyspextool.instruments.ishell.tracing import trace_orders_from_flat
import glob

flat_files = sorted(glob.glob(
    "data/testdata/ishell_h1_calibrations/raw/*.flat.*.fits"
))

# Trace with column range matching H1 calibration zone
trace = trace_orders_from_flat(flat_files, col_range=(650, 1550))

print(f"Found {trace.n_orders} orders")
print(f"Median polynomial RMS: {trace.fit_rms.mean():.2f} px")

# Convert to OrderGeometrySet for use in the 2DXD pipeline
from pyspextool.instruments.ishell.geometry import OrderGeometrySet
geom = trace.to_order_geometry_set("H1", col_range=(650, 1550))
print(f"OrderGeometrySet: {geom.n_orders} orders, mode={geom.mode!r}")
```

## Output Data Structure

`trace_orders_from_flat` returns a `FlatOrderTrace` dataclass:

| Attribute             | Type                              | Description                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `n_orders`            | `int`                             | Number of traced orders                       |
| `sample_cols`         | `ndarray (n_sample,)`             | Column positions used for profiling           |
| `center_rows`         | `ndarray (n_orders, n_sample)`    | Traced centre rows; NaN for missed detections |
| `center_poly_coeffs`  | `ndarray (n_orders, degree+1)`    | Polynomial coefficients (numpy convention)    |
| `fit_rms`             | `ndarray (n_orders,)`             | Per-order polynomial residual RMS (pixels)    |
| `half_width_rows`     | `ndarray (n_orders,)`             | Order half-width estimate (pixels)            |
| `poly_degree`         | `int`                             | Polynomial degree used                        |
| `seed_col`            | `int`                             | Column used for seed detection                |

The `FlatOrderTrace.to_order_geometry_set(mode)` method converts the
result to an `OrderGeometrySet` using the `OrderGeometry` class defined
in `instruments/ishell/geometry.py`.

**Important limitations of the produced geometry**:

* Only **order centres** are traced from the data.  The bottom and top
  edge polynomials are **approximated** as `centre ± half_width_rows`
  and are not independently fitted to the flat profile.
* Order numbers are **placeholder integers** (0, 1, 2, …).  Real echelle
  order numbers are assigned during the wavecal step.
* The resulting `OrderGeometrySet` is intended for development scaffolding
  and pipeline smoke-testing, **not** for science-quality rectification.

## Relationship to the 2DXD Arc-Line Tracing Stage

The tracing scaffold establishes the **order geometry** needed for the
first step of 2DXD rectification.  The pipeline proceeds as follows:

```
Flat tracing (this module)
    └── centre-line polynomial per order
    └── approximate edge polynomials
            │
            ▼
Arc-line tracing (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
    └── measure spectral-line tilt at each order
    └── fit tilt polynomial per order
            │
            ▼
Wavelength calibration (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
    └── identify arc lines against ThAr atlas
    └── fit wavelength polynomial per order
            │
            ▼
2DXD Rectification (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
    └── resample each order to (wavelength × spatial) grid
```

The `OrderGeometry` dataclass already has reserved fields for tilt, curvature,
wavelength, and spatial calibration polynomials (see `geometry.py`); they are
all `None` after the flat-tracing stage.

## Tests

Tests for the tracing module are in:

    tests/test_ishell_tracing.py

The test suite contains:

| Class                              | Coverage                                               |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `TestFlatOrderTraceDataclass`      | dataclass construction and `to_order_geometry_set()`   |
| `TestLoadAndCombineFlats`          | FITS loading, median combination, cosmic-ray rejection |
| `TestTraceOrdersFromFlatErrors`    | empty input, blank image                               |
| `TestTraceOrdersFromFlatSynthetic` | known-geometry flat, polynomial accuracy checks        |
| `TestModuleImport`                 | importability regression                               |
| `TestTraceOrdersH1RealData`        | smoke-test on real H1 calibration data (slow)          |

Run all tests with:

```bash
pytest tests/test_ishell_tracing.py -v
```

The `TestTraceOrdersH1RealData` class is automatically skipped when the
real FITS data is not present (LFS not pulled).

The real-data smoke test uses **intentionally loose acceptance criteria**
to reflect the first-pass nature of this scaffold:

* ≥ 35 orders detected (H1 mode has ~45; 2–3 edge orders may be missed
  due to low flat-lamp signal).
* Median polynomial RMS < 8 pixels (the scaffold routinely achieves
  ~3–4 px, but the threshold is conservative to accommodate different
  flat-frame conditions).

---

## What Remains Unimplemented

The following steps are explicitly **out of scope** for this scaffold:

1. **Precise order edge tracing** — currently the edges are estimated as
   `centre ± half_width`, which is an approximation.  A proper edge tracer
   would fit the half-maximum crossing point as a function of column.

2. **Per-order column-range trimming** — the packaged `H1_flatinfo.fits`
   specifies different `[x_start, x_end]` ranges for different orders (e.g.
   order 355 starts at column 960 rather than 650).  The current implementation
   uses a uniform column range for all orders.

3. **Arc-line tilt and curvature measurement** — measuring the tilt of
   emission lines from ThAr arc frames along each order.

4. **Wavelength calibration** — fitting a polynomial wavelength solution
   using identified arc lines.

5. **Spatial calibration** — mapping row offsets to arcseconds on sky.

6. **2DXD rectification** — resampling the raw 2D spectrum onto a
   (wavelength × spatial) grid.
